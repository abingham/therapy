therapy
=======

`therapy` is a collection of functionality that makes it simpler to
develop Python in Emacs. `therapy` doesn't aim to be an IDE, so to
speak. Rather, it collects and polishes bits and pieces of code that
polish the Python development experience in Emacs. For example,
`therapy` makes it relatively simple to run unit tests and to
reconfigure your emacs settings when you switch Python major
versions. `therapy` will probably grow and change over time.

`therapy` is intended to work well with other Python-related Emacs
packages like [`pyvenv`](https://github.com/jorgenschaefer/pyvenv) and
`python-mode`. If another package already does something well,
`therapy` will generally try to work with it. With that said,
`therapy` will need to be opinionated about what "does something well"
means, and you may not agree with it.
